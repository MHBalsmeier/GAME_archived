These are the coding standards that are important to me and that I insist on:

General principles

1. reliability
2. accuracy
3. performance

Structure

1. Several files are better than to put everything into one file.
2. Sort your files into meaningful directories.

Blank spaces

1. Never use more than one blank line.
2. Use blank spaces behind commas.

Names

1. Use underscores: new_variable.
2. Do not use capitals inside names: ThisIsForbidden.
3. Use long names that explain what this thing does and why it exists in order to avoid comments.

Comments

Explain only those things that somebody who is reading your code for the first time would need to know. Otherwise, do not use them much.
