\chapter{Overview}
\label{chap:overview}

This is only the handbook (manual) of the \texttt{General Geophysical Modeling Framework}, it explains how to configure, compile and run (use) the model. For a scientific derivation of the model see the documentation and the literature cited therein. The source code of the project is maintained on github (\url{https://github.com/MHBalsmeier/game}), this is also the place to ask questions or report errors. It is never wrong to think a bit before you post something there.

The \texttt{GAME} project incorporates four different executables:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{grid\_generator}, a program for creating model grids
\item \texttt{orography\_generator}, a tool for creating orography files
\item \texttt{test\_generator}, a tool for creating initialization states of test scenarios
\item \texttt{game}, the model executable itself
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Installation}
\label{chap:installation}

\section{Dependencies}
\label{sec:dependencies}

The following dependencies must be installed before being able to successfully build the model:

\begin{itemize}
\item geos95 \url{https://github.com/MHBalsmeier/geos95} for doing geospatial calculations
\item netcdf library for writing netcdf files
\item eccodes library (installation manual: \url{https://mhbalsmeier.github.io/tutorials/eccodes_on_ubuntu.html}) for writing grib files
\item CMake, because it is used for the build process
\item atmostracers (\url{https://github.com/MHBalsmeier/atmostracers}), an open-source libraries for calculating source terms for tracers in the atmosphere
\item rte-rrtmgp-c (\url{https://github.com/MHBalsmeier/rte-rrtmgp-c}), a C binding to the atmospheric radiation scheme RTE+RRTMGP
\item Python (only for the plotting routines, which are of course not part of the actual model)
\item OpenMPI (will be needed later for MPI parallelization, which is not yet implemented)
\end{itemize}

\section{Building}
\label{sec:building}

\texttt{CMake} is used for building \texttt{GAME}. The building process is managed using the bash scripts in the directory \texttt{build\_scripts}. The following list gives an overview of the scripts residing in this directory:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{debug.sh}: 
\item \texttt{build.sh}:  
\item \texttt{build\_install.sh}: The installation directory is controlled by the variable \texttt{aim\_dir}.
\item \texttt{install\_grids.sh}: Installs the grids to the installation directory.
\item \texttt{install\_tests.sh}: Installs the test state initialization files to the installation directory.
\item \texttt{install\_run\_scripts.sh}: Installs the run scripts to the installation directory.
\item \texttt{install\_output.sh}: Creates an empty subdirectory for output in the installation directory. This has the effect of deleting what has previously been in the directory.
\item \texttt{install\_plotting\_routines.sh}: Installs the plotting routines to the installation directory.
\item \texttt{install\_everything.sh}: Executes all the other install scripts.
\end{itemize}

Scripts with the suffix \texttt{\_dev} are not different from the original scripts, they only allow choosing a different installation directory for installations of test versions.

\chapter{Running the model}
\label{chap:running_the_model}

The configuration of the model must be set in three different files:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{src/enum\_and\_typedefs.h}: modify \texttt{RES\_ID}, \texttt{NO\_OF\_LAYERS} and \texttt{NO\_OF\_ORO\_LAYERS}. These must conform with the grid file and the initialization state file.
\item The file \texttt{src/settings.c}: modify the characteristics of damping at the model top and diffusion.
\item The run script: one of the files contained in the directory \texttt{run\_scripts}. The comments in these files explain the meaning of the variables.
\end{itemize}
%
Since the files \texttt{src/enum\_and\_typedefs.h} and \texttt{src/settings.c} are part of the model's source code, the model must be recompiled if something is changed in them. Alternatively, one can compile several executables and name them according to their configuration.

\chapter{Grid generation procedure}
\label{chap:grid_generation_procedure}

A grid is determined by the following five properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item the resolution, specified via the parameter \texttt{RES\_ID}
\item the orography, specified via the parameter \texttt{ORO\_ID}
\item the height of the top of the atmosphere, specified via the parameter \texttt{TOA}
\item the number of layers, specified via the parameter \texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_LAYERS}
\item the number of layers following the orography, specified via the parameter \texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_ORO\_LAYERS}
\end{itemize}
%
The grid generator needs to be recompiled for every specific resolution, top height, number of layers as well as number of orography following layers. Therefore change the respective constants in the file \texttt{grid\_generator.c} and execute the bash script \texttt{compile.sh}. Then run the grid generator using the bash script \texttt{run.sh} with the desired \texttt{\texttt{ORO\_ID}}. Table \ref{tab:grid_generator_run_file_explanation} explains all the parameters to be set in \texttt{run.sh}. Otimized grids have the postfix \texttt{\_SCVT}.

\chapter{Generating a new orography file}
\label{chap:generating_a_new_orography_file}

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|>{\centering}p{4.0 cm}|>{\centering}p{8 cm}|}
\hline \textbf{\texttt{ORO\_ID}} & \textbf{Description} \tabularnewline
\hline\hline 0 & no orography \tabularnewline
\hline 1 & orography of JW test \tabularnewline
\hline 2 & Gaussian mountain of 8 km height and 224 m standard deviation located ad 0 N / 0 E\tabularnewline

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Definition of orography IDs.}
\label{tab:oro_id_definition}
\end{table}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}

Orography files are generated with the code residing in the directory \texttt{orography\_generator/src}. Firstly, change the parameter \texttt{RES\_ID} in the file \texttt{orography\_generator.c} to the desired value and compile. Then source the bash scribt \texttt{run.sh} with the desired \texttt{\texttt{ORO\_ID}}. Tab. \ref{tab:oro_id_definition} shows the definition of the orography IDs. Real orography can be downloaded from
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{https://psl.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/db\_search/DBSearch.pl?Dataset=NCEP+Reanalysis\\\&Variable=Geopotential+height\&group=0\&submit=Search} (\texttt{ORO\_ID} = 3)
\end{itemize}
%
These files are stored in the directory \texttt{orography\_generator/real}. An information file explains them and defines their individual \texttt{ORO\_ID}s. A $1/r$-interpolation with four values is used to interpolate the data to the scalar data points.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Definition of test IDs.}
\label{tab:test_id_definition}
\end{table}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}

A new test state can be generated with the code in the directory \texttt{test\_generator/src}. Therefore, firstly change the parameters \texttt{RES\_ID}, \texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_LAYERS} and \texttt{NUMBER\_OF\_ORO\_LAYERS} in the file \texttt{test\_generator.c}. Then compile by sourcing the file \texttt{compile.sh} before executing the file \texttt{run.sh} with the specific \texttt{test\_id}. Tab. \ref{tab:test_id_definition} shows the definition of the test IDs.
