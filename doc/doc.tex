\section{Overview of schemes}
\label{sec:overview_of_schemes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Time stepping: Runge-Kutta third order scheme (RK3). In the vertical, at every substep, implicit methods are used.
\item Corolis: \cite{thuburn_f_discrete_plane} and \cite{ringler_trsk} modified by \cite{doi:10.1002/qj.3294}
\item kinetic energy: \cite{doi:10.1002/qj.1960}
\end{itemize}

\section{Code structure}
\label{sec:code_structure}

The code of the model resides in the directory \texttt{core/src}. It contains:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The file \texttt{coordinator.c}. This is the file containing the main method. It allocates and deallocates memory and manages the calls to the time stepping scheme as well as the output function.
\item The file \texttt{coordinator.h} contains the include statements of the file \texttt{coordinator.c}.
\item The file \texttt{enum\_and\_typedefs.h} contains physical constants as well as typedefs.
\item The directory \texttt{time\_stepping} contains an implementation of the RK3 scheme as well as vertical column solvers.
\item The directory \texttt{spatial\_operators} contains the implementations of the spatial operators needed for the prognostic equations.
\item The directory \texttt{diagnostics} contains functions computing diagnostic quantities needed for determining the values of the spatial operators.
\item The directory \texttt{io} contains anything related to input and output.
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance}
\label{sec:performance}

The \textit{speed} $s$ of a model is defined by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
s \coloneqq \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta\tilde{t}},
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\Delta t$ is the time step of the model and $\Delta\tilde{t}$ is the duration it takes to integrate from one time step to the next.

\section{NWP mode}
\label{sec:nwp_mode}

In NWP mode, one wants to be able to integrate one day within 8.5 minutes, which corresponds to $s = \frac{24\cdot 60}{8.5} = 169$. As a general rule, one can say that the computation time is in equal parts needed for data assimilation, the dynamical core and the processes involving moisture and radiation. Thus, the dynamical core has a mimimum speed of
%
\begin{eqnarray}
s \geq 509.
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Grid optimization}
\label{sec:grid_optimization}

Hexagonal spherical grids need to be optimized for numerical modeling. Therefore, the Lloyd algorithm is used, which yields a \textit{spherical centroidal Voronoi tesselation (SCVT)} after convergence \cite{Du2003}. \cite{PEIXOTO201361} gives an overview of optimization alternatives and it seems to be that the SCVT is the most suitable for modeling. The procedure employed for executing the Lloyd algorithm is the one described in \cite{10.1175/MWR2991.1}.

\subsection{Parallelization}
\label{sec:parallelization}

\section{Radiation scheme}
\label{sec:radiation_scheme}

GAME employs the so-called \texttt{RTE+RRTMGP (Radiative Transfer for Energetics + Rapid and Accurate Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Model Applications—Parallel)} \cite{doi:10.1029/2019MS001621}, \cite{rte-rrtmgp-github} scheme. It is bound to the C code through the API \texttt{RTE-RRTMGP-C} \cite{rte-rrtmgp-c-github}.
