The Global Geophysical Modeling Frame (GAME) is a global non-hydrostatic hexagonal C grid dynamical core with the possibility to advet a variable number of tracers. For the source terms, it makes use of the atmostracers library (https://github.com/MHBalsmeier/atmostracers). For radiation, it is coupled to RTE+RRTMGP via the C binding rte-rrtmgp-c (https://github.com/MHBalsmeier/rte-rrtmgp-c) (not yet).
